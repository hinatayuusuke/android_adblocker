# Project Purpose
- Android AdBlocker is a Flutter-based Android app that implements a DNS-only VPN using Android VpnService.
- It routes only DNS traffic through a TUN interface, applies blocklist/allowlist rules locally, and forwards allowed DNS to an upstream resolver.
- UI is minimal: start/stop VPN and manage allowlist.
